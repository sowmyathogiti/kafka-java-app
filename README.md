#### Created kafka-evenodd application
* In this application i have taken maximum number as 50, minimum number as 10 and range as "max - min + 1".
 #### Random number generation: 
 "rand = (int)(Math.random() * range) + min".
* This app will let us know whether the randomly generated integer is even or odd.
